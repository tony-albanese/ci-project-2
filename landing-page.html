        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        It is you against the computer. You choose either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. Your choice is pitted against the computer's. The winner is 
        determined based on the following rules.
        <ul>
            <li>Scissors cuts Paper</li>
            <li>Paper covers Rock</li>
            <li>Rock crushes Lizard</li>
            <li>Lizard poisons Spock</li>
            <li>Spock smashes Scissors</li>
            <li>Scissors decapitates Lizard</li>
            <li>Lizard eats Paper</li>
            <li>Paper disproves Spock</li>
            <li>Spock vaporizes Rock</li>
            <li>and, (as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenge Mode</h3>
        <p>In challenge mode, you are in a timed competition against the computer. The computer shows you its choice, and you have a limited amount of time to select 
        the option to win. Failure to chose in time means an automatic loss. </p>

        <p>There is a catch, though. The choice board shuffles each time to keep you on your toes.</p>
