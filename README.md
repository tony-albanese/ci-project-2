README for project


## Introduction
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a variation on the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. In the classic version, each of two players selects one of the three options to "show" their opponent by making a symbol with their fist. A fist for rock, an open hand with fingers together for paper, and two extended fingers (index and middle) for scissors. The winner is determined by the following rules : Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, and rock crushes scissors. The problem is that with only three choices, there are a limited number of outcomes and thus many games end up with a tie.

The solution, invented by XXXXX, was to increase the number of options each player has available to them. Thus the introduction of the lizard and Spock (the Science officer from the Star Trek franchise). The rules now are:
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
Rock crushes Scissors

With more options, there is a reduced liklihood of ending with a tie.

In normal gameplay, victory is mostly determined by chance unless the players are somewhow aware of a hidden strategy employed by the opponent. However, for players that know each other, patterns can emerge in gameplay.

The purpose of this project is to create an online game that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer using chance and/or skill to win.

### User Stories

As a user I want to:
+ Play the game on a large screen, tablet, or mobile screen.
+ Have some control the difficulty of the game
+ Use skill to increase my chances of winning the game
+ Have an intutitive and clear layout
+ Know where I stand as the game progresses
+ Have the option to play again or quit
+ Understand the meanings of the images intuitively
+ Understand why I have won or lost a round
+ See the connection to the Big Bang Theory
+ Access the rules of game easily

## UX Design

### Color and Font - Links to the show.
This game was made popular on the popular American TV Series "The Big Bang Theory" when Sheldon introduces the rules to the game. Many players of this game will likely feel some connection to the show and this is reflected in the color scheme and font choices.

The exact font used on the show is a trademark. The Impact font, availbale from Google Fonts, is one that is similar to that used on the show. The color scheme of the show was generated by coolers.io from an image of Sheldon's "Bazinga" shirt. Thus the blue and reddish colors used are based on the show's colors. Both color and iconography are combined in the title where the word "spock" is all capital and in the brick red color. This is in imitation of the shows logo wichh as similar typefacing. The borders and the buttons use the blue and red from the color palette which are similar to the show's. The background color was chosen to be related to but softer than the main colors so that the contrast is sharp enough.

### Use of graphics
The question marks are used to cover the choices of the computer and user. They are colored using the variation of blue and red from the tv show.

The images for the choices were chosen for their soft colors and clarity of meaning. Most users would agree as to their meaning. The only one that might be unclear is the symbol for Spock which is the hand with palm out and fingers parted in two groups of two. This is the vulcan greeting. Although an icon of pop culture, not everyone might grasp the connection to spock. (Although not everyone might undesrstand who or what Spock is.) An image of Mr Spock might run into copyright issues. Therefore the emoji for the vulcan greeting was used. These images are licensed for free use.

### Main Screen
The app has one main screen which contains all of the essential elements of the game. This area is divided into three sections. 

#### Game Information Area
The top section contains a row of elements that are to display the player's choice, then the score board which presents the information on the current score and the current round, and then the area that displays the computer's choice. The coloring is different to create distinction and the color of the score is keyed to the color of player and computer. This was done to save screen real estate. 

#### Choice Images
The second section contains a panel of five images (called "tiles") that represent the choices a player can make. These are placed in a flex display so that they are displayed in a single row on larger screens but wrap on smaller screens.

#### Button Row
The last section contains row of a button to initiate gameplay and a checkbox to indicate if the user wants to play the challenge game.

#### Modal Overlays
The user must know not only what the current score is and what round they are on, but also must be provided with feedback as to what the outcome a particular round is, who the winner of the game is, and as to when to make a choice. One could use the alert() JavaScript method to display some information to the user. However, this is not ideal as the alert has generic styling that breaks the theming of the game. One could also employ dialogues from frameworks such as Bootstrap or Materialize. This also is not a good choice as these dialogue boxes are for applications. In commercial video games, dialogue boxes have a "gameified" look. (give example) I wanted to do that here.

The solution is to use a modal overlay. These are elements that cover the screen and prevent the user from interacting with the elements below. They are perfect for displaying information on time of the screen and then either be programmed to disappear automatically after a period of time or when the user dismisses them.

Overlays are simple HTML elements. Their initial display is set to none to make them initially invisible and then they can be programmatically made to appear and disappear as needed. These overalays are styled with CSS like any other HTML elements.

I chose overalys to cover the entire screen with an overlay to prevent interaction. In additon, I styled the elements the overlay (which are just text and some buttons) to have the same font and color scheme as the rest of the game. Overlays are used to announce the winner of a round, the winner of a game, and in the simple game, to prompt the user to make a choice by indivdiually flashing the words "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!". At the end of the game, in addition to being notified as to who won, the user is presented with two buttons offering the option to play again or to quit the game.

Modal overlays are also used at the end of a particular round. It is not enough to know simply who one. The user must also know why they won or lost. Thus, a message is displayed next to the notification of a win or loss stating the game rule. For example, if the user selected rock and the computer Spock, then the overlay showing the following would appear: "You lose. Spock vaporizes rock." Or, if the user won, they would be told why. For example f the user chose paper and the computer chose rock, the message: "You won. Paper covers rock." would appear in the overlay.
