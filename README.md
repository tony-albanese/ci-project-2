README for project


## Introduction
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a variation on the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. In the classic version, each of two players selects one of the three options to "show" their opponent by making a symbol with their fist. A fist for rock, an open hand with fingers together for paper, and two extended fingers (index and middle) for scissors. The winner is determined by the following rules : Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, and rock crushes scissors. The problem is that with only three choices, there are a limited number of outcomes and thus many games end up with a tie.

The solution, invented by XXXXX, was to increase the number of options each player has available to them. Thus the introduction of the lizard and Spock (the Science officer from the Star Trek franchise). The rules now are:
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
Rock crushes Scissors

With more options, there is a reduced liklihood of ending with a tie.

In normal gameplay, victory is mostly determined by chance unless the players are somewhow aware of a hidden strategy employed by the opponent. However, for players that know each other, patterns can emerge in gameplay.

The purpose of this project is to create an online game that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer using chance and/or skill to win.

## UX Design

This game was made popular on the popular American TV Series "The Big Bang Theory" when Sheldon introduces the rules to the game. Many players of this game will likely feel some connection to the show and this is reflected in the color scheme and font choices.

Used Impact font from Google Fonts - similar to BBT.
Used color palette generated from Bazinga. BBT colors
